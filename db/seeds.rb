Naturally it sounds a bit dated now, but I still like the atmosphere that I created with it. Trance DJ Marco Torrance played it at the beginning of one of his sets on Digitally Imported back in the day, which I was really proud of at the time. There's even a bootleg of this track floating about the internet in which some guy added a David Guetta vocal on top.

I went to visit my old friend Mike, who earned quite a bit of success as a trance producer back in the day. We chopped up some vocals and played some heavily-verbed guitar.
